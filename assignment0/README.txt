I compiled and ran my code by following the instructions provided in the pdf. I did not face any problems or difficulties in particular.

I did not collaborate with anyone in the class.

I didn't find a really helpful reference. I was mostly googling.

I didn't find any problem in my code. I did the easy extra credit, which is continuous color changing and rotating the object. Since we can only use the button C, I decided to fix a color palette. Whenever the user press the button, the teapot will smoothly transition to the next color in the palette. 

I think this assignment is fine, but it would be better if more guidance is given. There were just too many folders to look at. My previous experience of c++ were mostly on competitive programming, which involves solving a single algorithmic problem with code. This assignment does require a very different skill set, and I was kind of confused in the middle.
