I did the easy extra credit of making the cloth smooth instead of wireframe. 

I compiled and ran my code on MacOS. 

I did not collaborate with anyone in this class.

I sometimes use chatGPT for some c++ syntax references. 

I think everything works when we use ./assignment3 r 0.005, however, if we use e 0.0001 the cloth will explode. 

I like this project overall, but the screenshot part seems confusing since the grader could just run the code which is a lot easier than we taking consecutive screenshots.
