I tested my code on MacOS. I did not collaborate with anyone in the class.
I used chatGPT when there were syntax problems and sometimes for debugging. For example, I have asked it "skin_node->SetActive(draw_mode_ == DrawMode::SSD); why does this give me segmentation fault?". Then it explains that I might have used std::move to move the unique_ptr. It tells me what I should do instead.

One problem with my code is that the skin does not have the same color everywhere. I think it is the faceted normal problem. The assignment document says that I do not have to address that problem yet, so I leave it as it is.

I did not do any extra credits. I like this assignment overall!
