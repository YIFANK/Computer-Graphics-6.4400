I ran the code on MacOS 15.4.1. 

I did not collaborate with anyone in the class.

I sometimes asked chatGPT for clarifications on the OpenGL library. For example, I was wondering why I could not transpose glm::vec4 and it explains stuff. I asked it about the format of an OBJ file. Initially I did not turn off the keyboard command when multiple curve exists, and I asked it why only one curve changed when I pressed the key.

I did not notice any problem with my code. 

I spent quite a while debugging my B-spline implementation, then I realized that I used T (t^3,t^2,t,1) as the vector while the matrix given in the assignment used (1,t,t^2,t^3). I think I learned a lot from this assignment, and it was rewarding to see the teapot actually rendered by my code.
